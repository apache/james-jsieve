Comments, Questions and Issues
------------------------------
jSieve is a sub-project of Apache James. Please direct your comments and questions to 
the relevant James list.

To report issues, such as bugs, go to

Version 0.3
----------- 
This release is the first to include mailet and utility modules, in addition to the core parsing
library. The configuration API has changed significantly to replace magic singletons with POJOs
suitable for IoC. The default configuration mechanism has been retained so though calls have
changed, existing configurations should still be compatible.
 
Utilities include node serializers to xml and sieve script. The mailet module provides Sieve
in the James 3 codebase.

Java 1.5 is now the minimum version required.
