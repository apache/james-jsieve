:navtitle: Integration Guide

An integrator is someone who integrates jSieve into an email system
for the purpose of making Sieve functionality available to 
xref:jsieve:user:index.adoc[users].

Integrators grab an instance of org.apache.jsieve.SieveFactory in order
to get an instance of a Sieve parser.
