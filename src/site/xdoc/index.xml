        jSieve is a Java implementation of the Sieve mail filtering
        language defined by
        <a href='http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3028.txt'>RFC 3028</a>
        . jSieve is implemented as a language processor that can be
        plugged into any internet mail application to add Sieve support.
      </p>
      <p>
        jSieve is a subproject of
        <a href='http://james.apache.org'>Apache JAMES</a>
        . All who are interested in developing jSieve and JAMES will be
        warmly welcomed on the

        .
      </p>
      <p>jSieve consists of three products:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href='core/index.html'>Apache JSieve</a>
          is a Sieve library coded in Java.

        <li>
          <a href='mailet/index.html'>Apache JSieve Mailet</a>
          is a
          <a href='http://james.apache.org/mailet'>Mailet</a>
          which builds on the JSieve library to create a comprehensive
          server side Sieve filtering system.

        <li>
          <a href='util/index.html'>Apache JSieve Utilities</a>
          contains utility classes helpful when using Sieve but not
          considered sufficiently core to be included in the main
          library.

      <subsection name='What is Sieve?'>
        <p>
          Sieve is an extensible mail filtering language. It's limited
          expressiveness (no loops or variables, no tests with side
          effects) allows user created scripts to be run safely on email
          servers. Sieve is targeted at the final delivery phase (where
          an incoming email is transferred to a user's mailbox).
        </p>
        <p>
          Sieve scripts are composed of commands. Control commands
          manage the execution of the script. Test commands define
          side-effect free criteria. Action commands are mail operations
          to be performed.
