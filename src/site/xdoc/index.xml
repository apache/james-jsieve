      <p>
        jSieve is a Java implementation of the Sieve mail filtering
        language defined by
        <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5228'>RFC 5228</a>
        . jSieve is implemented as a language processor that can be
        plugged into any internet mail application to add Sieve support.
      </p>
      <p>
        jSieve is a subproject of
        <a href='http://james.apache.org'>Apache JAMES</a>
        . All who are interested in developing jSieve and JAMES will be
        warmly welcomed on the
        <a href='mail-lists.html'>mailing lists</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>jSieve consists of two products:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href='core/index.html'>Apache JSieve</a>
          is a Sieve library coded in Java.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='util/index.html'>Apache JSieve Utilities</a>
          contains utility classes helpful when using Sieve but not
          considered sufficiently core to be included in the main
          library.

      </ol>
      <subsection name='What is Sieve?'>
        <p>
          Sieve is an extensible mail filtering language. It's limited
          expressiveness (no loops or variables, no tests with side
          effects) allows user created scripts to be run safely on email
          servers. Sieve is targeted at the final delivery phase (where
          an incoming email is transferred to a user's mailbox).
        </p>
        <p>
          Sieve scripts are composed of commands. Control commands
          manage the execution of the script. Test commands define
          side-effect free criteria. Action commands are mail operations
          to be performed.

        <abbr title='Sieve Email Filtering: Body Extension'><a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5173'>RFC 5173</a></abbr> describes 
        an extension command that tests the body of an email for one or more strings.
